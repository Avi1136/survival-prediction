# Titanic Survival Prediction (Machine Learning Project)

## Overview
- Built a Machine Learning model to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster.
- Dataset sourced from Kaggle.
- Demonstrates the complete ML pipeline from raw data to prediction.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Google Colab

## Project Details
- Used the Titanic dataset containing passenger details such as age, gender, class, fare, and embarkation port.
- Cleaned the dataset by handling missing values in columns like Age and Embarked.
- Converted categorical features (Sex, Embarked) into numerical values.
- Selected important features that influence survival prediction.
- Created visualizations to understand survival patterns among passengers.
- Built and compared multiple machine learning models.
- Evaluated model performance using standard evaluation metrics.

## Workflow
1. Dataset collection from Kaggle.
2. Data loading and inspection using Pandas.
3. Data cleaning and handling missing values.
4. Data preprocessing and encoding categorical variables.
5. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
6. Feature selection and preparation.
7. Splitting data into training and testing sets.
8. Model training using:
   - Logistic Regression
   - Decision Tree
9. Model evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrix.
10. Result analysis and interpretation.

## Key Learnings
- Data cleaning and preprocessing techniques
- Feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation
- Data visualization
- End-to-end machine learning workflow

## Future Improvements
- Use advanced models like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting.
- Perform hyperparameter tuning.
- Improve feature engineering.
- Deploy the model as a web application.
